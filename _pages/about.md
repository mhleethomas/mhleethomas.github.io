# Data-Driven, Impact-Oriented.

Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas â€” a curious problem solver with a background in both chemistry and data science. I started my journey in the lab, where precision and attention to detail shaped the way I see the world. Over time, that same mindset naturally pulled me toward data â€” discovering patterns, solving complex problems, and turning messy numbers into meaningful insights.

Right now, Iâ€™m pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Systems at Northeastern University. Along the way, Iâ€™ve dived deep into machine learning, data engineering, and statistical analysis â€” skills I love applying to real-world challenges. Whether itâ€™s detecting cracks in concrete with deep learning models or predicting housing prices with spatial data, Iâ€™m always drawn to projects that bridge data and impact.

Before grad school, I worked as a Process Engineer in the semiconductor industry. Thatâ€™s where I truly learned the power of data-driven decisions â€” optimizing processes, automating measurements, and seeing firsthand how numbers improve production quality (and even win you awards!).

Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new Python libraries, learning about the latest AI trends, or enjoying a good cup of coffee while diving into data visualizations. Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, connecting ideas across disciplines, and finding ways data can make life â€” and business â€” a little smarter.

# Work Experience
- **Process Engineer**, [Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corp.](https://www.kinsus.com.tw/), Hsinchu, Taiwan, *May 2022 - Sept 2023*
  - Conducted statistical analysis and Design of Experiments (DOE) to optimize production processes, achieving a 100% reduction in defect rate and enabling mass production, which earned the Star Award for excellence.
  - Developed and implemented automated measurement systems integrated with Statistical Process Control (SPC) databases, improving measurement accuracy by 20-fold and capacity by 14-fold.
  - Leveraged ETL techniques (data extraction, transformation, and validation) to preprocess accuracy metrics such as Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility (GRR), significantly reducing measurement errors.
  - Applied Excel Macros and VBA scripting to optimize process parameters, enhancing sorting accuracy and improving defect detection capabilities in production workflows.
